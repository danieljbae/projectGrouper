### About Our Project:

**Vision Statement:**
We would like to develop a tool allowing users to work collaboratively and build projects that are of mutual interest.  With an emphasis on welcoming users of all experience levels, we seek to create a pathway to mutual learning through project development, professional networking, and endless opportunities for hands on experience working with desired technologies. 

**Motivation:**
Our motivation for this project stems from our shared experience as students pursuing this program in an entirely remote capacity, with an interest in collaborating and often finding ourselves unsure how to go about connecting with others interested in similar projects. While it can be challenging to find others with shared project interest and availability, project experience can have a profound impact on future job opportunities and networking opportunities. Additionally, we find that working in a group setting can also promote self-accountability and make a daunting project more manageable.

**What Types of Risk:**
We face a few challenges at the outset of this project, namely learning several new technologies, and keeping the scope of the project within the realm of reasonability to complete within the semester.  

**Mitigation Strategy:**
To mitigate these risks, we have discussed a strategy to keep the scope realistic as we make decisions about how to prioritize features throughout the completion of our project. Additionally, as we make decisions pertaining to the scope of the project, we will be factoring in time commitments needed to learn new technologies in addition to the time it will take to complete prioritized features. 

**Development Method:**
We will be using the Kanban development method for our project. We have created a Trello project board, a team Slack channel for stand up style check-ins through the week, and established a recurring weekly team meeting to sync on action items and next steps.

**Project Tracking Software:** Trello
